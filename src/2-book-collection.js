// Part A: Use Object.keys() and a for loop to print each book and its availability in this format:
// "The Bluest Eye: 3 copies available"
// "Beloved: 5 copies available"
// etc...

// Part B: Calculate and log the total number of books across all titles (should be 15)
// Hint: You'll need a variable to keep track of the running total as you loop through the keys
